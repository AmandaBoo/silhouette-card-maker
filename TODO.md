- is there a way to prefer borderless art for a set? (especially useful for lands)
- create a calculator that takes in a number of cards and then
  - calculates the price (ink, paper, laminate, sticky notes x 4)
  - calculates the worst case time estimate 
    - 1/13 lamination fails
    - 2/13 silhouette fails which trigger another reprint + laminate + silhouette flow
