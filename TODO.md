- is there a way to prefer borderless art for a set? (especially useful for lands)
- is there a way to get a moxfield or some compatible output for tokens?
  - yes
  1. find links on scryfall ie : https://scryfall.com/card/tkld/1/beast
  2. send them into a file io parser that takes in the quantity i want, then parses the set acronyn + upper cases it, number, and name
  3. (this is also usable for non token cards where i need to replace the art)
